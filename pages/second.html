    <p>Page 2
    <p>Chicago is known as the birthplace of modern architecture. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, many architects flocked to the city for the opportunity to take part in the city's rebuilding efforts. One architect who came to Chicago to make a name for himself was Frank Lloyd Wright. Also, even though it stood only 10 storeys tall, but Chicago’s Home Insurance building was the world’s first skyscraper. From Willis Tower to the Marina City Towers along with the Wrigley Building and Rookery Building, Chicago isn’t afraid to make a statement. In fact, Chicago’s amazing designs and groundbreaking engineering feats have influenced architecture worldwide. Down below shows the Chicago Insurance Building.</p></p>
